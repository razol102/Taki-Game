A console-based Taki game written in C This project represents my very first substantial endeavor during my first year of collegeâ€”a console-based Taki game written in C. At the time, the entire code was compressed into a single file, reflecting the early stages of my coding journey. Now, as I share this project, it serves as a testament to my growth and development as a programmer. Dive into the code to witness the progression from a consolidated file to a more structured and refined version, showcasing the strides I've made in organizing and optimizing my code.
